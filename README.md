I used React JS to create this project. The majority of my work
          consisted of the application's logic and design. Prior to starting any
          coding I spent time scheming the app's architecture and used Adobe XD
          to wireframe a design.  I used
          Sass as a CSS preprocesser becuase of it's customizability and ease.
          All the code is hosted on Github. A live version is being hosted via
          AWS connected to my repository. This was a very nice setup that allowed
          me to develop and deploy within minutes.
